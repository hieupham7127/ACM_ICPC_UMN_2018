ACM_ICPC_UMN_2017

ACM ICPC Practice Session. University of Minnesota, Fall 2018.

Tips:

1. For each algorithm, first do several google search and pick few of them to understand it in high-level.
2. For each algorithm, know the input, output, and the main idea.
3. In your choice of programming language, write a template for the algorithm (or find one). You don't have to understand some of the complicated algorithms in detail.

We are meeting at Keller 1-250 (computer lab) every Friday 3:30pm - 5:00 pm
