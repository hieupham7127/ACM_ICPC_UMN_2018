# Greedy and Dynamic Programming

** Greedy **
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/greedy/basics-of-greedy-algorithms/tutorial)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
- [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/greedy-algorithm)
- CSCI 4041: Rod Cutting, Activity Selection, Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra's Shortest Path, etc.
- CSCI 5421: Matroid (for those who are interested in mathematics and proofs)
- [List of problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms)

** Dynamic Programming (DP) **
- [TopCoder](https://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=features&d2=040104)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/wiki/tutorial-dynamic-programming)
- [Stanford CS97SI](http://stanford.edu/class/cs97si/04-dynamic-programming.pdf)
- Key words: Base cases, Subproblems, Memoization
- [List of problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming)

Note:
- DP solution is relatively sort; if you find yourself writing dozens of lines of code for a DP problem, you might want to review your solution.
- Solving DP problems is like either you get the solution or you get nothing, so don't spend too much time for just one DP problem while there are other easier ones.
